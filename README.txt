How to use the program : 
1. Make sure you have python 3 installed on your computer.
2. Run the program on a WINDOWS computer
3. Follow on screen instructions


Limitations of the program : 
1. It only works on windows. It will not work on linux/android/mac systems.
2. When you have to type a positive answer to a prompt, you must write a capital Y like this 'Y'.
3. When you enter a category for the categories, it is case sensitive. chance is not the same as Chance.
4. When you are entering the dice that you want to reroll, you must enter them in the proper format which is like this : 1 2 3 4 5  OR 1 3 4 NOT 12345 OR 134
5. All inputs must be entered in the exact right format (including spaces, 'chance ' is not the same as 'chance') or the program will crash.

I included both the OS and the RANDOM modules. The random module is so I can get the dice to roll random numbers. Without it, the dice would not work. The OS module is so that I can execute the 'cls' command in the windows command prompt so that I can clear the window. It is used for formatting, and making the program look good.

NOTE : The program is very easy to make crash. Make sure to follow on screen instructions and respond to the prompts correctly in the correct format.
